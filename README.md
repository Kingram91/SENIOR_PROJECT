Course Description:
------------------
This is the capstone experience for computer science students intended to promote a successful transition to professional practice or further academic study. Students spend the term working on computing projects as teams. Students have the opportunity to develop and practice essential project management skills and work with current software tools and technologies.

The primary objective of the course is to provide a capstone experience for CS students, and in particular to promote a successful transition to the work place or further academic study. Students will have the opportunity to practice essential project management skills and work with current software tools and technologies. Student teams will develop a project scope, project plan, document functional specifications, develop a design document, implement specified functions, provide weekly progress reports, give project presentations, conduct final project presentation to the instructor and/or project sponsor, and provide a complete final report that includes documentation of all work products resulted from the class activities. Each team will designate a team leader who is responsible for coordinating work tasks, team meetings, communications with the instructor and/or project sponsor, and team effort.
